Our website, Philly Transit, aims to make the history of Philadelphia's public transportation available for residents and transit enthusiasts. Tens of thousands of riders take public transportation daily, but a lot of them do not know the history of the Broad Street Line or the Market-Frankford Line. Its history stretches back a hundred years and the evolution of our trains, buses, and trolleys makes for an interesting story. Philly Transit has an interactive map, three transit timelines, a gallery, and more!

As students riding the train every day, we are fascinated with the different kinds of tracks, trains, trolleys, abandoned stations, and plans. Our friends also commonly share an interest in the history of public transportation and how their favorite trains have changed over the years, and the different plans that are in place for future renovations.  We both want to share our hobby with the rest of Philadelphia.
